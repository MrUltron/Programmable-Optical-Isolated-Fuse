Programmable Laser-Isolated Fuse System (76V)A Cyber-Physical Architecture for Industrial Load Monitoring & Protection🚀 Project OverviewThis project addresses the safety and noise challenges in high-voltage industrial environments ($76\text{V}$). Unlike traditional fuses, this system provides real-time telemetry and is physically isolated from the control logic via an optical bridge.🔬 Key InnovationsGalvanic Isolation: Uses a Laser-LDR bridge to prevent high-voltage back-feed to sensitive microcontrollers.EMF Immunity: Data transmission via photons (light) is immune to the electromagnetic noise generated by heavy industrial motors.Programmable Logic: Thresholds are software-defined, allowing for remote resets and custom trip-curves via IoT integration.🛠️ Technical Implementation (Phase 1: Sensing Core)The current implementation focus is the High-Side Sensing Stage, validated in LTspice.SpecificationValueInput Rail76V DCOp-AmpLT6016 (Over-the-Top™ Architecture)Shunt Resistance$0.1\Omega$Sensitivity$1\text{V}$ Output per $1\text{A}$ Load CurrentSwitching ElementSi9420DY N-Channel MOSFET📈 Simulation ResultsFigure 1: Triangle wave simulation proving perfect $1\text{V/A}$ scaling across the operating range.🚀 System ArchitectureSensing: LT6016 detects 76V current and converts it to a 1V Analog Signal.Isolation: The analog signal drives a Laser Diode, where brightness is proportional to the load current.Recovery: An LDR Sensor converts light back to an electrical signal for an IoT Node.Action: If the load exceeds the user-defined threshold (set via WiFi/BLE), the controller trips the MOSFET to protect the system.🔮 Future VisionThe architecture is designed to integrate Machine Learning algorithms to perform Predictive Maintenance. By analyzing the "fingerprint" of load spikes, the system can identify motor wear-and-tear or potential failures before a hardware shutdown is required.📂 How to Run the SimulationInstall LTspice.Clone this repository to your local machine.Open Simulations/Project1_76V_Fuse.asc and click the Run icon to view the pre-configured waveforms.
