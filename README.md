⚡ Programmable Laser-Isolated Fuse System (76V)Cyber-Physical Architecture for Industrial Load Monitoring & Protection🚀 OverviewThis project presents a "Smart Breaker" architecture designed for high-voltage industrial applications. It bridges the gap between high-power industrial hardware ($76\text{V}$) and sensitive low-power IoT logic using light-based isolation.🔬 Key InnovationsGalvanic Isolation: Utilizes a Laser-LDR bridge to prevent high-voltage back-feed to sensitive microcontrollers.EMF Immunity: Data transmission via photons is immune to the electromagnetic noise generated by heavy industrial motors.Programmable Logic: Thresholds are software-defined, allowing for remote resets and custom trip-curves via IoT integration.🛠️ Technical ImplementationThe current implementation focus is the High-Side Sensing Stage, validated in LTspice.Hardware SpecificationsInput Rail: 76V DCOp-Amp: LT6016 (Over-the-Top™ Architecture)Shunt Resistance: $0.1\Omega$Sensitivity: $1\text{V}$ Output per $1\text{A}$ Load CurrentSwitching Element: Si9420DY N-Channel MOSFET📈 Simulation ResultsFigure 1: Triangle wave simulation proving perfect $1\text{V/A}$ scaling across the operating range.🚀 System ArchitectureSensing: The LT6016 detects 76V current and converts it to a 1V Analog Signal.Isolation: The analog signal drives a Laser Diode, where brightness is proportional to the load current.Recovery: An LDR Sensor converts light back to an electrical signal for an IoT Node.Action: If the load exceeds the user-defined threshold, the controller trips the MOSFET to protect the system.🔮 Future VisionThe architecture is designed to integrate machine learning algorithms to perform predictive maintenance. By analyzing the "fingerprint" of load spikes, the system can identify motor wear-and-tear or potential failures before a hardware shutdown is required.
