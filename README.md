1 Overview
This project presents a “Smart Breaker” architecture designed for high-voltage industrial ap-
plications. It bridges the gap between high-power industrial hardware (76V) and sensitive
low-power IoT logic using light-based isolation.
2 Key Innovations
• Galvanic Isolation: Utilizes a Laser-LDR bridge to prevent high-voltage back-feed to
sensitive microcontrollers.
• EMF Immunity: Data transmission via photons is immune to the electromagnetic noise
generated by heavy industrial motors.
• Programmable Logic: Thresholds are software-defined, allowing for remote resets and
custom trip-curves via IoT integration.
3 Technical Implementation
The current implementation focuses on the High-Side Sensing Stage, validated through simula-
tion in LTspice.
3.1 Hardware Specifications
Component Specification
Input Rail 76V DC
Operational Amplifier LT6016 (Over-the-Top™ Architecture)
Shunt Resistance 0.1Ω
Sensitivity 1V Output per 1A Load Current
Switching Element Si9420DY N-Channel MOSFET
4 Simulation Results
The simulation validates the linearity of the sensing core. The sensitivity is defined by the
relationship:
Vout = Iload × Rshunt × G
Where G represents the gain of the sensing stage. A triangle wave simulation proves perfect
1V/A scaling across the operating range.

5 System Architecture
The architecture follows a four-stage process:
1. Sensing: The LT6016 detects 76V current and converts it to a 1V Analog Signal.
2. Isolation: The analog signal drives a Laser Diode, where brightness is proportional to
the load current.
3. Recovery: An LDR Sensor converts light back to an electrical signal for an IoT Node.
4. Action: If the load exceeds the user-defined threshold, the controller trips the MOSFET
to protect the system.
6 Future Vision
The architecture is designed to integrate machine learning algorithms to perform predictive
maintenance. By analyzing the “fingerprint” of load spikes, the system can identify motor
wear-and-tear or potential failures before a hardware shutdown is required.
